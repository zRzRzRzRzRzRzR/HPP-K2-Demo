Ayana (Patient ID: 29803) was evaluated on Nov 7, 2025, referred by Dr. Alex. Sex and age were not specified in the available clinical records.  

She presented with a 3-year history of fatigue, shortness of breath with exertion (e.g., after climbing stairs), and elevated home blood pressure readings. Additionally, she reported forgetfulness, including misplacing items and repeating questions, and her family noted slowed movement and reduced energy levels. Symptoms were rated as moderate in severity (7/10).  

On admission, physical and investigative findings were as follows. General health assessment revealed moderate fatigue and reduced exercise capacity, with a BMI of 27.5 kg/m², waist circumference 92 cm, and waist-to-hip ratio 0.90, consistent with central obesity. Cardiovascular evaluation showed an office blood pressure of 156/88 mm Hg and heart rate 72 bpm. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) documented daytime systolic blood pressure (SBP) 155 mm Hg, nighttime SBP 142 mm Hg, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) 107 mm Hg. Central hemodynamic measurements included a central SBP of 139 mm Hg and augmentation pressure 13 mm Hg. Arterial function tests revealed pulse wave velocity (PWV) 12.4 m/s and reactive hyperemia index (RHI) 1.6. Echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular mass index (LVMI) of 110 g/m² with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 56%. Coronary computed tomography (CT) confirmed a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of 480 Agatston units. Respiratory assessment noted normal breathing at rest, oxygen saturation 98% on room air, but shortness of breath after exertion. Gastrointestinal findings included fair appetite without nausea or vomiting; however, she reported a preference for salty soups and preserved foods, which may influence sodium intake. Neurological examination showed mild slowness of movement and attention. Brain MRI revealed a white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume of 13 mL, and her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 26/30. Musculoskeletal evaluation found normal strength but mild deconditioning due to low activity. Psychiatric assessment indicated mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score 10) and a daytime sleepiness score of 11, with no evidence of anxiety or psychosis. Renal function tests showed an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m² (stage 3 chronic kidney disease), urine protein excretion 1.0 g/day, serum phosphate 5.0 mg/dL, parathyroid hormone (PTH) 85 pg/mL, and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) 170 pg/mL. There was no history of kidney stones. Current dietary advice included a low-sodium diet (5 g/day) and potassium intake of 2.5 g/day.  

Ayana’s clinical presentation and findings support several key impressions. Her long-standing hypertension (>20 years) and current ABPM results (daytime SBP 155 mm Hg, nighttime SBP 142 mm Hg) indicate persistent blood pressure elevation, contributing to left ventricular remodeling (LVMI 110 g/m²) and coronary artery calcification (CAC 480 Agatston). Chronic kidney disease stage 3 with stable eGFR (45 mL/min/1.73 m²) and proteinuria (1.0 g/day) is associated with renal mineral metabolism abnormalities (elevated phosphate, PTH, FGF23), requiring ongoing management. Central obesity and dyslipidemia, as reflected by her history and need for lipid-lowering therapy, likely amplify cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. Neurological and cognitive changes, including mild WMH volume (13 mL) and prior lacunar infarct, alongside MMSE score 26/30 and reported forgetfulness, suggest early cerebrovascular cognitive impairment. Mild depressive symptoms and daytime sleepiness warrant attention to mental health and sleep quality. Her preference for salty foods may challenge adherence to the low-sodium diet, necessitating dietary counseling.  

The treatment plan, initiated on day 0, involved concurrent administration of three pharmacologic agents: Evolocumab and Alirocumab (both PCSK9 inhibitors) and Rosuvastatin (a statin). These medications were started simultaneously per the "parallel" schedule. The intended goals included enhancing lipid reduction to mitigate coronary artery calcification progression and reduce myocardial infarction (MI) risk, given her high CAC score and prior cardiovascular events. Over the 90-day treatment horizon, monitored clinical indicators (daytime and nighttime SBP, central SBP, MAP, LVMI, WMH volume, PHQ-9 score, sleepiness score, waist circumference) remained stable, with no significant changes observed. Routine monitoring for adverse effects and medication adherence was conducted, and no major complications were reported. The modeled risk trajectory indicated a gradual reduction in MI risk, with the hazard ratio multiplier decreasing from 0.996 on day 1 to 0.9999 by day 90, suggesting potential long-term benefits despite stable acute measurements.  

At discharge, after 90 days of treatment, clinical indicators remained consistent with baseline values. Daytime SBP was 155 mm Hg, nighttime SBP 142 mm Hg, central SBP 139 mm Hg, MAP 107 mm Hg, LVMI 110 g/m², CAC score 480 Agatston, WMH volume 13 mL, PHQ-9 score 10, and sleepiness score 11. The discharge medication regimen includes Evolocumab (PCSK9 inhibitor), Alirocumab (PCSK9 inhibitor), and Rosuvastatin (statin). Lifestyle recommendations emphasize continued adherence to the low-sodium diet (5 g/day) and monitoring potassium intake (2.5 g/day) to support renal function and blood pressure control. Increasing physical activity to improve exercise capacity and reduce cardiovascular risk is advised. Regular follow-up is recommended to monitor blood pressure (office and ambulatory), renal parameters (eGFR, urine protein, phosphate, PTH, FGF23), and neurological/cognitive status (MMSE, MRI if indicated). Psychiatric follow-up should continue to assess depressive symptoms and sleepiness, with consideration for non-pharmacologic interventions such as behavioral therapy. Patients are instructed to promptly report any new symptoms (e.g., chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, confusion) or adverse effects (e.g., muscle pain, gastrointestinal upset). Medication adherence is critical to optimizing long-term risk reduction, particularly given the modeled improvement in MI risk over the treatment period.
