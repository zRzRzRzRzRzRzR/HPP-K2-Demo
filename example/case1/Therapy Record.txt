A 79-year-old woman, Ms. Ayana, was admitted because of gradually progressive exertional fatigue, slowing of memory and thinking, and intermittent dizziness for three years, with clear aggravation during the last six months. She had a 20-year history of hypertension and a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes. Daily physical activity was low, with approximately 2,500 steps per day, and diet featured frequent preserved foods and salty soups. On arrival her temperature was 36.6 °C, pulse 72 bpm, respiratory rate 18/min, blood pressure 156/84 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Body mass index was 27.4 kg/m² and waist-to-hip ratio 0.91, indicating central adiposity. Cardiovascular examination showed a sustained apical impulse without murmurs; lungs were clear; no peripheral cyanosis; mild ankle edema was present.

Laboratory testing revealed fasting plasma glucose 7.6 mmol/L and HbA1c 7.3%. Serum creatinine corresponded to an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45 mL/min/1.73 m². Serum phosphate measured 5.0 mg/dL, parathyroid hormone 82 pg/mL, and fibroblast growth factor 23 was mildly elevated. Urinary protein excretion was approximately 1.0 g/day. Lipid profile showed LDL-cholesterol 3.8 mmol/L and non-HDL cholesterol above target. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was slightly raised. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring recorded elevated daytime and nighttime systolic values with increased 24-hour variability. Carotid ultrasound demonstrated mean intima–media thickness of 1.2 mm without critical stenosis. Pulse wave velocity was 12.4 m/s. Coronary CT calcium scoring exceeded 400 Agatston units. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mild concentric left-ventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction around 55% and evidence of impaired relaxation. Brain MRI displayed multiple periventricular white-matter hyperintensities and several old lacunar infarcts consistent with small-vessel disease; hippocampal volumes were age-appropriate. Screening questionnaires indicated a PHQ-9 score of 10 and daytime sleepiness score of 12.

The working diagnosis on admission was long-standing hypertension with cardiac remodeling, stage-3 chronic kidney disease with albuminuria and secondary mineral dysregulation, severe coronary artery calcification, and cerebral small-vessel disease causing vascular cognitive impairment; risk factors included high dietary sodium intake, central obesity, physical inactivity, and suboptimally controlled atherogenic lipids. The treatment strategy emphasized simultaneous control of blood pressure, renal protection, lipid lowering, mineral balance, and lifestyle restoration.

Dietary sodium restriction to less than 2 g/day equivalent was initiated with dietitian counseling, together with increased consumption of potassium-rich foods tailored to kidney function. A supervised walking program began with 10-minute bouts twice daily, progressing to 6,000 steps per day by week eight, and moderate-to-vigorous activity was built toward 150 minutes per week. Pharmacotherapy included perindopril 4 mg daily uptitrated to 8 mg, later combined with chlorthalidone 12.5 mg daily to maintain systolic pressures near the low 130s without orthostatic symptoms. Early after dose escalation, serum creatinine rose by about 10% and stabilized; serum potassium remained 4.8 mmol/L. To reduce albuminuria and slow renal decline, dapagliflozin 10 mg daily was started with sick-day guidance; urinary protein fell by roughly half within three months and the annual eGFR slope flattened on subsequent measurements. For lipid control, atorvastatin 40 mg nightly reduced LDL-cholesterol to 1.6 mmol/L; because residual risk persisted, a PCSK9 inhibitor was added, achieving further atherogenic lipoprotein reduction. Dietary phosphate moderation and vitamin D supplementation were prescribed; follow-up testing showed modest reductions of phosphate and parathyroid hormone.

During outpatient follow-up at three and six months, home and clinic blood pressures remained consistently controlled; the patient reported improved stamina and sleep quality. Repeat vascular assessment showed pulse wave velocity improved from 12.4 to 10.9 m/s. Echocardiography at nine months documented partial regression of left-ventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction. Neurocognitive evaluation demonstrated better processing speed and attention; the PHQ-9 score fell to 5 and daytime sleepiness to 7. At one year, brain MRI showed no new ischemic lesions and stable white-matter hyperintensity volume. There were no recurrent cerebrovascular or coronary events throughout an 18-month observation period. The patient maintained the low-sodium diet, continued regular walking and resistance exercises, and remained independent in daily activities. The overall course was judged satisfactory, with hemodynamic stabilization, renal parameters maintained, atherogenic lipids at goal, and neurological status stable without further decline.
